# EXCEL and NOBLE Trials

The recent [EXCEL](https://app.box.com/s/ctg96ejtsk88xy95b0pwllvma9du4eud) and [NOBLE](https://app.box.com/s/ffw5sn1fov4tb7t0ud5sk63v0q22de21) trials are
randomised clinical trials of percutaneous coronary intervention versus coronary artery bypass surgery for left main disease.

The trials have some important differences (size,population, distribution of SYNTAX scores, end-points, duration of follow-up).
However, they have different conclusions.

The exploration [here](http://rpubs.com/atomofjustice/excel-noble) looks at the plausibility of PCI having higher composite event rate than CABG for left ain disease.
