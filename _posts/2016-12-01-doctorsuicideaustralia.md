This post is based on the paper by [Milner et al](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2016/205/6/suicide-health-professionals-retrospective-mortality-study-australia-2001-2012). It is a [Bayesian analysis](https://rpubs.com/atomofjustice/doctorsuicideaustralia) of the event rates.

- It is plausibe that doctor suicide is higher than non-health professional occupations. 
- Midwives and nurses appear higher risk than the medical profession
- Male doctors have approximately 5 times the rate of female doctors
- Older ages seem to have lower rates
